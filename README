This is a basic application for a monitoring a service.
For my example, I have used a Pizza Monitoring service.

The following technologies were used -
MEAN STACK - MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, NodeJS
The following dependencies need to be installed using npm install
      - express
      - mongojs
      - bodyParser

In this, as and when the database is updated with more Pizza orders, the display shows the orders with the progress in making of each pizza.
There are 6 stages in the process of a pizza order : 
      "orderPlaced", "baseCreated",  "Baking", "addingToppings", "packing", "OrderDelivered".
      Each of these stages can have 3 different status values : "not-started", "in-progress" and "Done".
      These 3 status are indicated by colours : 
            "not-started" : "grey", 
            "in-progress" : "yellow",
            "Done" : "green"

The status gets refreshed automatically every 5 seconds.
