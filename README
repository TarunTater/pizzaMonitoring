This is a basic application for a monitoring a service.
For my example, I have used a Pizza Monitoring service.

The following technologies were used -
MEAN STACK - MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, NodeJS
The following dependencies need to be installed using npm install
      - express
      - mongojs
      - bodyParser

In this, as and when the database is updated with more Pizza orders, the display shows the orders with the progress in making of each pizza.

The status gets refreshed automatically every 5 seconds.
